# Getting and cleaning data (course 3 in the Data Science Specealization on Coursera)  - course Project 

This Repository has my solution to the assignment for the Getting and cleaning data course Project, that includes the "run_analysis.R"  file which enables the user to run the analysis done to tidy the data, "averages_data(tidy).txt" the end version of the data after running the script(run_analysis.R), this "README.md" File and "CodeBook.md" file, which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.


The data is provided to me from the course 

Dataset used: "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"
Version:1.0

Notes : this analysis assumes the presence of the dataset in the working directory and writes the resulting tidy dataset into the "averages_data(tidy).txt" using the Method required by the course(write.table() using row.name=FALSE)
